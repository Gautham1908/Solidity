# Solidity
Solidity is an open-source language, and its development is overseen by the Ethereum Foundation. It is widely used by developers building decentralized applications on the Ethereum network and is one of the most popular smart contract languages in use today.


Solidity is a high-level programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a statically typed language that supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features. Solidity code is compiled to bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts allow for the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) that operate without the need for intermediaries or centralized control.

Solidity is designed to be similar to other popular programming languages, such as JavaScript and C++, making it relatively easy for developers to learn and use. It also includes many features specifically tailored to the needs of smart contract development, such as the ability to handle Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.
